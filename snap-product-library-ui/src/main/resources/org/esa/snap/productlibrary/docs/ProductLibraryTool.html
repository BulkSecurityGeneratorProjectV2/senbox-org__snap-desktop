			The Product Library Tool allows the user to search for products on a certain repository using specific filters to retrieve the product list. 
			Each repository has its own filters and some of them are mandatory.
		</p>

		<p>
			The products may be searched in terms of mission, satellite, product type, date and time of acquisition. They may also be searched by graphically drawing an area of interest on the world map.
