<a name="Overview"></a>


<p class="subSectionTitle">Overview</p>

<p>
    The Reproject tool enables you to take any file (one which contains geo-coding) and resample it into a new file
    of a specified map projection. Some key parameters which you can specify are: coordinate reference system (CRS),
    resolution, masking, interpolation method, and geographic location.
</p>

<p>This tool is available both from the GUI and from the command line.
</p>

<p>

    Figures 1a and 1b illustrate the results of applying this tool to a level-2 file using an oblique stereographic
    projection. The greenish portion of the image is a surface reflectance band and the shape of the level-2 boundary
    can be seen in the projection. Land (in brown) and water (in aqua) masks have been applied in order to display pixels
    outside of the original level-2 file boundaries.

<p class="subSectionTitle">Concepts</p>


<p>
    <b>Valid Pixels and NaNs</b><br>There is not a one-to-one correspondance between the pixels of the input file and
    those of the output reprojected file. To handle this, the Reproject tool masks out invalid pixels and ultimately
    reprojects only the valid pixels of the source file. This hidden automated pixel validation step is acheived using
    the following two
    criteria: the <i>valid pixel expression</i> and the designation of a <i>no-data value</i>. You can view/modify this
    criteria by
    right-clicking on any band, and selecting <i>Properties</i>. Alternatively you can view this with the <i>Band
    Info</i> tool (<i>Analysis > Band Info</i>)
    when selecting the band.

</p>
<p>
    In general this is the desired behavior, unless the valid pixel expression is masking on an ideal range, outside of
    which there
    may actually be valid data. If you wish to include this out-of-range data in the reprojection then you will need to
    edit the
    valid pixel expression of the band(s) of the source file before reprojecting. One example of this would be when
    creating true color
    imagery using surface reflectances. Because the surface reflectance product is designed based on water leaving
    radiances for the ocean, pixels which image cloud tops
    can exceed a reflectance value of 1. In this case, for the case of including bright clouds in your true color
    imagery, the valid
    pixel expression band(s) of the source file would need to be modified so as to not throw away values above 1.


</p>

<br>
<i><b>Statistics and Mapped Imagery</b></i>
<p>
    In general, it may be best to consider mapping a file one way for statistics and another way for displaying data.
    For statistics you are best served using an equal area map projection (such as Albers Conic Equal Area, Lambert
    Azimuthal
    Equal Area, Sinusoidal, ...). With an equal area projection, the Earth surface area is the same for each resultant
    pixel and can be treated as such with an equal per pixel weighting. However, for large scenes, an equal area map
    projection
    may not look natural so using a conformal projection (such as Mercator and Stereographic) is
    more ideal when displaying this type of imagery.
</p>
<p>

    <i>Note: selection of the "best" map projection is dependent on scene size (is it global, regional, local), scene
        shape
        (does it run narrow north-south, narrow west-east, or is it more square in shape), and scene location (is it at
        the
        equator, at one of the Poles, or some span of latitudes soemwhere between the Pole and equator.</i>

</p>


<br>
<i><b>Upsampling</b></i>
<p>
    Upsampling is the process of resampling (remapping) your data to a higher resolution. Upsampling has no inherent
    problems,
    other than the fact that the resultant file will be increasingly larger with higher resolutions. A remapped
    upsampled image
    will tend to be clearer than one remapped at a resolution comparable with the original input file. The higher the
    resampling
    resolution, the closer you approach to seeing the pixel shapes of the original unprojected file.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Note: Ideally a remapped
        image should not be displayed at a zoom level such that it displays the pixellation of the output file. Such a
        visual
        might cause a viewer to incorrectly infer a measurement of noise (or lack of noise) pixel to pixel, when
        in fact
        these pixels do not bear a one-to-one correspondance with the native satellite detector measurements.</i>
</p>


<br>
<i><b>Downsampling</b></i>
<p>
    Downsampling is the process of resampling (remapping) your data to a lower resolution. Downsampling by more than a
    factor of 4 does have some inherent problems, at least in the SeaDAS Reproject and its related GUI tools (see note
    1). This is because SeaDAS currently only offers 3 interpolation methods (nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic)
    which use a matrix size on the input file of 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4 respectively to generate each remapped pixel of the
    output file. (<a href="../general/ResamplingMethods.html">See method details.</a>) Downsampling by greater factors
    than these matrix sizes, will result in many of the pixels in the source file being ignored. Basically, in order to
    ensure that all source data pixels are being use, if you are downsampling by a factor of 4 then use bicubic, a
    factor of 2 then use bilinear or bicubic, and a factor of 1 then use any of the three.

</p>
<p><i>Note 1: The resampling(remapping) concept and process is the same in all of the SeaDAS visualization resampling
    tools: Reproject, Collocate, Mosaic, and Time Series.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Note 2: The SeaDAS OCSSW tools for binning and mapping behave differently and do not ignore
        any source data pixels for large factor downsampling</i>

</p>

<p class="i1">

    <i>Figure 2. Map Projection & Settings Tab</i>

</div>

<br><br>


<p>
    <i><b>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</b></i><br>
    There are 3 options for selecting a CRS: create on yourself - "Custom CRS"; select one - "Predefined CRS"; or use
    one
    from an existing file - "Use CRS of file".
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Custom CRS</b><br>
    With this option you will manually select the map projection (along with it's parameters) and the datum to use.
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Geodetic datum</b><br>
    The coordinate system for locating positions on the Earth. In general, these are based on reference ellipsoids used
    to represent the shape of the Earth. You can select from a variety of datums. The most common (and SeaDAS default)
    is "WGS 84" (WGS 1984, EPSG:4326).

</p>

<p class="i2">
    <b>Projection</b><br>
    The map projection (or how the 3 dimensional Earth's surface will be transformed on a 2 dimensional surface).
    Select from a list of map projections. If a projection requires parameters then the "CRS Parameters" button will
    become selectable.
</p>

<p class="i3">
    <b>CRS Parameters</b><br>
    This opens a window of selectable parameters needed by the selected map projection. These contain default values,
    but likely
    you will want to modify these values based on your scene location or region of interest.
    (See <a href="Reprojection.html#crsParameters" class="invisibleLink">CRS Parameters</a> for a more on these
    parameters)
</p>


</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Predefined CRS</b><br>
    SeaDAS contains a multitude of pre-defined coordinate reference systems including the EPSG (European Petroleum
    Survey Group) Geodetic Parameter
    Dataset. Use the selector to the right to choose one
    of these projections. (
    See <a href="Reprojection.html#Figure4" class="invisibleLink">Predefined CRS</a> for more on this).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use CRS of file</b><br>
    Select a file from your system (one with geo-coding) and use the identical map projection criteria and geographic
    boundaries of that file. This will have the effect that both files are collocated (same raster grid size and grid
    geocoding) but separate files. See the Collocation Tool if you wish to actually merge the files together.
</p>
<br>


<p>
    <i><b>Output Settings</b></i>
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Preserve resolution</b><br>
    Use the SeaDAS defaults which will automatically determine a "best-fit" resolution, output file size, and easting
    and westing.
    You can deselect this and manually set these parameters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Add delta lat/lon bands</b><br>
    Specifies whether or not delta latitude and longitude bands will be added to the target product. These are virtual
    bands, which can be used to assess the accuracy of the new geo-coding given by the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
    with respect to the old geo-coding.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Reproject tie-point grids</b><br>
    Specifies whether or not the tie-point grids shall be included. If they are reprojected they will appear as bands in
    the target product and not any more as tie-point grids.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>No-data value</b><br>
    The default no-data value is used for output pixels in the projected band which have either no corresponding pixel
    in the source product or the source pixel is invalid.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Resampling method</b><br>
    This is the interpolation method. Choose between Nearest, Bilinear, and Bicubic. (<a
        href="../general/ResamplingMethods.html">See details</a>)

    Really the wording on this should be "Edit sizing". We will have to look into this. Regardless, clicking "Reset"
    will set

<p class="i1">
    <i><b>A bit more about the Easting and Northing fields and the Reset button</b></i><br>

    The Easting and Northing fields can be a bit intimidating and not so intuitive, however basically you need to ask
    yourself whether
    you want the geographic boundaries of your output file to be adapted to "best-fit" and include all the data from the
    input scene, or
    whether you have a specific and exact geographic boundary for your output file in mind.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    For the former "best fit" case, SeaDAS can calculate default Easting and Northing values based on your scene
    boundaries and
    CRS criteria. To do this, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of this GUI window. Of note is that the very
    first time you open this sub window during a SeaDAS session, the default will be calculated and applied,
    but from that point onward the assumption is that the value in the textfield is the value which you want to use
    If you make further changes to the CRS criteria or change to a different file, then you will again need to click
    "Reset".
</p>
<p class="i1">

    For the latter case, since the false easting and false northing fields also appear with the CRS definition it may be
    better
    or perhaps more clear to set them there and then set the values here to 0.0 for each. Either way, keep in mind that
    the actual
    false easting and false northing is the sum of the corresponding values in the CRS parameters and Output Parameters.

    Each band of the source file has a valid pixel expression which designates whether a pixel is valid for display

    consider whether or not to allow the "invalid" pixels to be used or ignored.  The default behavior is to treat

    <b>Mask at source file</b><br>
    When this is selected the pixels which are not "valid" will be ignored.  When this is deselected, the pixels which
    are not "valid" will be used in the reprojection process.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Transfer to output file</b><br>
    When this is selected the logical expression itself will be copied from each source band to its corresponding
    band in the reprojected file.  If deselected, then the valid pixel expression of the reprojected band will be empty.

</p>



<br>


<p>
    <i><b>Mask Expression</b></i><br>
    In addition to the option of masking out invalid pixels as designated by the valid pixel expressions of the source
    bands, you can create a custom logical expression to further constrain which pixels of the source band get used.
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Edit ...</b><br>
    This accesses the Expression Editor to help you construct a logical expression.  Note that the mask expression
    you create here is applied to each of the bands.

<p class="subSectionTitle">Command Line Tool (GPT)</p>

<p>
    The Reproject tool can also be run from the command line using SeaDAS GPT (graph processing tool). All parameter
    options within the GUI are also supported for the command line version with a few minor parameter name differences
    which
    will be noted below.
</p>
<p>
    GPT "collocatedWith" = GUI "use CRS of file" <br>
    GPT "crs" can be either XML or the EPSG Authority (for example EPSG:4326, AUTO:42001, etc.) <br>
    GPT "wktFile" as an input is not available in the GUI, but the GUI can create and display the CRS WKT of the
    specified CRS
    parameters
    which could subsequently be used on the command line. <br>
</p>

<p><i>Note: The GPT Reproject tool also includes the Orthorectification.</i> </p>
