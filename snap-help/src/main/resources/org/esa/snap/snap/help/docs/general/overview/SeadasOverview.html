<h4>SeaDAS General Overview</h4>

<p>
    SeaDAS is a comprehensive software package developed by NASA OBPG (Ocean Biology Processing Group) for the
    processing, display, analysis, and quality control of remote-sensing Earth data SeaDAS is open-source and
    serves as the official distribution point of the NASA OBPG Science Software. This science processing component
    of SeaDAS applies the OBPG algorithms to satellite data in order to characterize and calibrate the data and
    generate science quality OBPG products. Additional coinciding ancillary data are retrieved and used to correct
    for and calibrate out the atmospheric components of the signal in order to determine an Earth/ocean surface
    component of the signal and consequently to generate higher order products in the optical path such as
    Chlorophyll, SST, KD_490, etc.  SeaDAS processing provides a standardized data format across a multitude of
    satellites, currently supporting over 15 US and international satellite missions. The visualization and
    analysis tools can also be used on many other unsupported satellite missions. Customized algorithms can be
    developed and applied within SeaDAS to evaluate ocean, land and atmospheric data, as well as to produce
    true color imagery. SeaDAS can also integrate SeaBASS format field measurement (in situ) data for comparative
    analysis with relevant satellite data. Scientific data products can be exported from SeaDAS in file formats
    readily readable by many third party GIS analysis packages.

<h4>SeaDAS Platform, SeaDAS Toolbox and Sentinel 3 Toolbox</h4>




<h4>SeaDAS Platform and SNAP Platform</h4>



<p>The <b>Sentinel Application Platform</b> - or <b>SNAP</b>
    - in short is a collection of executable tools and Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) which have been developed to facilitate
    the utilisation, viewing and processing of a variety of remotely sensed
    data. The functionality of SNAP is accessed through the <b>Sentinel
        Toolbox</b>. The purpose of the Sentinel Toolbox is not to
    duplicate existing commercial packages, but to complement them with
    functions dedicated to the handling of data products of earth observing
    satellites.</p>

<p>The main components of the Sentinel Toolbox are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An intuitive desktop application used for EO data
        visualisation, analysing and processing.
    </li>
    <li>A set of scientific data processors running either from the
        command-line or invoked by the desktop application.
    </li>
    <li>The command-line tool <b>gpt</b> (graph
        processing tool) is used to execute processing graphs made up of <i>operators</i>
        nodes developed using the SNAP GPF (see Java API below).
    </li>
    <li>A data product converter tool <b>pconvert</b>
        allowing a user to convert raw data products to the <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a> standard
        format, to <a href="../geotiff/ExportGeoTIFF.html">GeoTIFF</a>,
        to <a href="../../visat/ExportHDF.html">HDF-5</a>
        or to RGB images.
    </li>
    <li>A <b>Java&#8482; API</b> which provides ready-to-use
        components for remote sensing related application development and
        plug-in points for new SNAP extension modules. Besides a number of
        extension points such as product reader and writers, the SNAP API
        comprises the <b>Graph Processing Framework</b> (GPF)
        which is used to rapidly create raster data processors. The <b>Rich
            Client Platform</b> is used to develop rich GUI user interface
        applications based on SNAP.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Standard Product Format</h4>
<p>The Sentinel Toolbox application and the scientific data
    processors use a simple data input/output format, which makes it easy
    to import data in other imaging applications. The format is called
    DIMAP<sup>®</sup>
    and has been developed by SPOT-Image, France. The SNAP software uses a
    special DIMAP profile called <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a>,
    which has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A single product header (XML) containing the product
        meta-data
    </li>
    <li>An associated data directory containing ENVI<sup>®</sup>-compatible
        images for each band.
    </li>
    <li>Each image in the directory is composed of a header file
        (ASCII text) and an image data file (flat binary)
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Source Code</h4>
<p>The complete SNAP software has been developed under the GNU
    public license and comes with full source code (Java<sup>TM</sup>). The source code is available on GitHub
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="https://github.com/senbox-org">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>https://github.com/senbox-org</u></html>">
    </object>
</p>
<h4>Supported Platforms</h4>
<p>SNAP is programmed in pure Java&#8482; to allow a maximum
    portability. The SNAP software has been successfully tested under MS
    Windows&#8482;&nbsp;XP<sup>®</sup>,&nbsp;Vista,&nbsp;7,8,10 and also Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and as well as
    under Linux and Solaris<sup>®</sup> operating systems.</p>
