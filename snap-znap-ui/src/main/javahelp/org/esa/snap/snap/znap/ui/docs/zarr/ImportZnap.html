<h3>Import ZNAP</h3>

<p>This command allows to import the data of a ZNAP format.</p>
<p>ZNAP data is either written as a single zip archive with the extension ".znap.zip" or written in several files
    within a data folder with the extension ".znap".</p>
<p>To open a product select either the zip archive (with extension <b>".znap.zip"</b>) or any file
    inside the data folder with the extension <b>".znap"</b> in the file chooser. Alternatively you can also
    Drag-and-Drop either the data folder or the zip archive onto the Product Explorer in SNAP.</p>
<p>
    For more details regarding the format and write options see: <a href="ExportZnap.html">ZNAP writer</a>.</p>
